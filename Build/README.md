# Advanced Calculator

A Java-based advanced calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations and advanced mathematical functions.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Advanced mathematical functions:
  - Square root
  - Power (exponentiation)
  - Logarithm (base 10 and natural)
  - Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
  - Absolute value
  - Floor, ceiling, and round
  - Random number generation
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Clean and user-friendly interface

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE
3. Run the `Calculator.java` file
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations
